# spring-boot-and-admin

Fork of a spring-boot sample project, combined with a test of spring-boot-admin.

To see a demo, start the AdminServer class once, and then the ClientServer class as often as you want. Then use http://localhost:8080/ (and login with user/password, literally) to see the spring-boot-admin ui.
